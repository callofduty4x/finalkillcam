# Final killcam for CoD4X
Bring your CoD4X server up-to par with newer Call of Duty's by adding a final killcam.
Every time a map has ended, the server will show the final killcam to all the players.
Works in all gamemodes: free-for-all, team deathmatch, domination, sabotage and search and destroy.

## Installation
First create a folder called `main_shared` in the root of your server installation (if it does not exist already).
Now just copy the files to it, keeping the original folder structure as in this repository.
For example `main_shared/maps/mp/gametypes/_finalkillcam.gsc`.
